    "body": "2022/03/02 - About the Project: ‚ùì What are C3 Systems?: In the military context, C3 Systems are fundamental to operations by delivering the critical information required to plan, coordinate and control forces and operations across defence missions in real-time. What the Super C3 System is: The Super C3 System is a powerful desktop app that serves the planning, monitoring and execution needs of army soldiers across the various vocations during wartime exercises and operations. It follows a modular software architecture and builds on a Smart Geographical Information System (GIS). Why it Started:   The legacy system that the Super C3 System replaces has poor UX, requires tasks to be completed manually and has poor data integration. Author / copyright holder: Text by Tessa Goh / Icons created by Ariel Kotzer, P Thanga Vignesh and voneff respectively from Noun Project. The Super C3 System replaces an existing legacy system that has become increasingly obsolete. With the outdated system, user experience was poor, and many mundane and procedural tasks with automation potential still had to be done manually. A new replacement was long overdue to improve work efficiency. Advances in communication technology also mean data integration is now possible to allow better interoperability across the army forces, which was previously impossible with the old technology and poorly integrated modules. Primary Design Goals:  Create a user-friendly experience to reduce resources on user training by aligning with commercial design patterns.  Be a great landing pad. Many users will be transitioning from the existing legacy system, which should be a fluid experience.  Raise work efficiency by harnessing the potential of automation, eliminating the effort required for procedural tasks. Team Structure:   The project team splits into smaller development teams consisting a lead developer and couple with one or a pair of UX designers. Author / copyright holder: Tessa Goh. Copyright terms and license: Tessa Goh. Managed by two product managers, the project team consists of ~20 software developers and a small design team. The design team grew from a strength of two to four towards the last quarter of 2021. The project team splits into 3-5 development teams (depending on the project timeline) and practices the Scrum methodology, with bi-weekly sprints held concurrently. Each development team has a ScrumMaster cum lead developer and couples with at least one or a pair of UX designers. I was matched with three development teams and collaborated closely with a fellow UX designer when she joined the team. The Design Process: For the modules in the system under my charge, I adhered to a consistent design process in my delivery. User Research: As a team, I conducted user research sessions through qualitative user interviews and user research workshops to elicit user needs and pain points from the users‚Äô existing work processes. We also synthesised design opportunities from ‚ÄòHow Might We‚Äô statements gathered from these user research sessions. Insights: I generated UX artefacts to document complex military workflows and align the project team in the existing user flows. Prototyping: I created the information architecture and low-fidelity concepts for primary use cases and workflows. After obtaining the green light from the product managers, developers and stakeholders, these concepts are translated to high-fidelity and interactive digital mock-ups, most times by my teammate or occasionally by myself. Usability Testing: I led my team to conduct testings of our product to verify designs nearing product release.  Before product releases, we tested our designs with various user groups by simulating mission scenarios to ensure the product was usable and covered all their operational needs. Seeing Results:   The overall system usability improved from 50. 0 to 63. 6 following a revamp of the system's UX. A module I designed was rated a SUS score of 80. 8 (falling into the 'Good' category of the SUS Acceptability Score range) and was estimated by a user to reduce up to 90% of the total time required in their existing workflow. Author / copyright holder: Tessa Goh The overall system usability improved from an average System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 50. 0 to 63. 6 following a revamp of the system‚Äôs user experience.  For one of the modules I designed,     The average SUS score was 80. 8, and   a user estimated the module to reduce up to 90% of the total time required in their existing workflow.    A Mini Design System: I co-led the delivery of a mini design system that specifies the system‚Äôs design principles and guidelines. This mini design system helps ensure design consistency throughout the Super C3 System and alignment with the C3D Design System. Project Learnings:  Anyone can be a user (but yourself). It is easy to fall prey to the false-consensus effect when designing. Always test to verify a design. When time is lacking, anyone can be the user, including our project mates. Sometimes, a fresh new perspective is all that is needed.  Test early and continuously. Involving stakeholders/users in the process as early as possible can help identify loopholes and unlock insights that save precious time and effort later on.  Prioritisation is key. Focus on delivering a quality MVP first when rolling out new features/functions and avoid getting distracted by out-of-scope requests (or sometimes, even your own ideas).  The design ‚â† the final product. Sometimes we can get carried away with producing pixel-perfect designs, but what matters most is always the final product delivered. When resources are tight, ensuring the product is developed right should be the priority. ‚ÄºÔ∏è Disclaimer: *As a past employee at DSTA, I am to abide by the Official Secrets Act and safeguard the confidentiality of the information I have had access to during my employment.

    "title": "Improving Google MyMaps",
    "body": "2019/12/07 - The Focus: Users who use the platform for their travel trips, which generally consists of three stages:  the initial brainstorming, creation of the trip itinerary and navigation during travel. Competitive Analysis: I looked into popular travel planning apps to understand what makes a travel planning app great. The three well-received apps I narrowed down in my research were Sygic Travel, TripAdvisor and TripIt. Unsurprisingly, each of these apps has a solid feature that sets it apart from other apps on the market:  Sygic Travel: Seamless GPS navigation with the travel itinerary TripAdvisor: Smart suggestions, readily available reviews and forums, ease of booking TripIt: One-stop depository of the travel itinerary and booking confirmationsThe Main Getaway: These apps are all itinerary-based, contrasting the GoogleMyMaps platform, which is layer-based. Even though allowing users to sort their saved places into different layers offers more customizability, this sorting process can be manual and tedious. User Research: To improve the platform, I needed to know why existing users were dissatisfied with Google MyMaps. App Ratings &amp; Reviews: Looking through the app listing in the Google Play Store, ‚Äúthe lack of integration with Google Maps‚Äù was common feedback I spotted (which echoed my brief experience with the platform). Qualitative Feedback: I also conducted a short online survey with 15-20 participants using SurveyMonkey to obtain more feedback on the platform. The feedback gathered can be summarised as such: Insights: After conducting the competitive analysis and user research, I summarised the user needs and frustrations in a user persona. &lt;&gt; I also mapped out the user journey, splitting it into the three stages identified prior, and listed the opportunities for improvements accordingly for each. &lt;&gt; Conceptualisation: It was clear to me at this point what the focus areas were for improving the platform, and they were to:  better the integration of the platform with Google Maps, optimise the platform for itinerary planning and improve the platform‚Äôs accessibility on mobile while travelling on the goWireframing: I started conceptualising improvements with the creation of low-fi wireframes. &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; The Solution: &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; Bonus: Integration with Smart Assistants (Google Assistant): &lt;&gt;Reminders to leave for the airport to catch the flight, start the journey towards the next stop on the itinerary list and offer suggestions when something crops up. Evaluation: Areas for Improvement: My solution assumes that mobile access is mainly for referencing the itinerary while navigating on the go during travel. However, this may be a skewed assumption because of typical unpredictability in travel trips. One might want to add a stop to the itinerary or even make a shift in plans. Re-evaluating Assumptions: &lt;&gt;The basis of this case study focuses only on one particular user group on the platform; those who use it for their travel planning. However, Google MyMaps is also often used to present map data. It might not have been fair thus to compare the platform with other travel planning apps since their primary use case does not align.
