    "body": "2022/02/11 - RoleUser Experience Architect DurationMar 2020 - Mar 22 Background: The Queen‚Äôs Guard and Queen‚Äôs Life Guard (called King‚Äôs Guard and King‚Äôs Life Guard when the reigning monarch is male) are the names given to contingents of infantry and cavalry soldiers charged with guarding the official royal residences in the United Kingdom. The British Army has regiments of both Horse Guards and Foot Guards predating the English Restoration (1660), and since the reign of King Charles II these regiments have been responsible for guarding the Sovereign‚Äôs palaces. The Guards are fully operational soldiers. The Queen‚Äôs Guard and Queen‚Äôs Life Guard are mounted at the royal residences that come under the operating area of the British Army‚Äôs London District, which is responsible for the administration of the Household Division. This covers Buckingham Palace, St James‚Äôs Palace and the Tower of London, as well as Windsor Castle. The Queen‚Äôs Guard is also mounted at the sovereign‚Äôs other official residence, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, but not as often as in London. In Edinburgh, the guard is the responsibility of the resident infantry battalion at Redford Barracks. It is not mounted at the Queen‚Äôs private residences at Sandringham or Balmoral.  The Queen‚Äôs Guard is the name given to the contingent of infantry responsible for guarding Buckingham Palace and St James‚Äôs Palace (including Clarence House) in London. The guard is made up of a company of soldiers from a single regiment, which is split in two, providing a detachment for Buckingham Palace and a detachment for St James‚Äôs Palace. Because the Sovereign‚Äôs official residence is still St James‚Äôs, the guard commander (called the captain of the guard) is based there, as are the regiment‚Äôs colours. When the Sovereign is in residence, the Queen‚Äôs Guard numbers three officers and forty other ranks, with four sentries each posted at Buckingham Palace (on the forecourt) and St James‚Äôs Palace (two in Friary Court, two at the entrance to Clarence House). This reduces to three officers and 31 ORs, with two sentries each, when the Sovereign is not in residence. The Queen‚Äôs Guard is not purely ceremonial in nature. They provide sentries during the day and night, and during the later hours, they patrol the grounds of the Palace. Until 1959, the sentries at Buckingham Palace were stationed outside the fence. This stopped following an incident involving a female tourist and a Coldstream Guardsman ‚Äì due to the continued pestering by tourists and sightseers, the guardsman kicked the tourist on the ankle as he marched. The tourist made a complaint to the police and the sentry was confined to barracks for ten days. Not long after, the sentries were moved inside the fence. "

    "body": "2020/02/02 - Within the H√¥tel de Crillon, which was built in 1758, Les Ambassadeurs operated as a restaurant since the mid-19th century. It reached its peak of fame as a restaurant and nightclub (a caf√©-concert) in the last three decades of the 19th century. Always a center of entertainment for the aristocracy, in the 1870s it also became a regular destination of some of the best known figures of art and the demi-monde. Edgar Degas and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec portrayed visitors at the night club, and Aristide Bruant performed there.  It was decorated in an 18th-century rococo style, redesigned by Sybille de Marg√©rie with furnishings by Sonia Rykiel. Following a renovation of the hotel in 1981‚Äì85, the restaurant occupied a former private ballroom with windows looking out on the Place de la Concorde, a few hundred meters from the Palais Garnier. Les Ambassadeurs had two Michelin stars. In the last decade of its operation, chef was Dominique Bouchet followed by Jean-Fran√ßois Pi√®ge and finally when the hotel closed in 2013 for an extended renovation, Christopher Hache. In 2017 Hache opened a smaller restaurant, L‚Äô√âcrin, within the renovated hotel; the former space of Les Ambassadeurs became a bar. "
