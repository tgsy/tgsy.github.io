<h3 id="about-the-project">About the Project</h3>

<h4 id="what-the-super-c3-system-is">What the Super C3 System is</h4>
<p>In the military context, C3 Systems are fundamental to operations by delivering the critical information required to <strong>plan, coordinate and control forces and operations across defence missions</strong> in real-time.</p>

<p>The Super C3 System is a powerful desktop app that serves the <strong>planning, monitoring and execution needs</strong> of army soldiers across the various vocations during wartime exercises and operations. It follows a modular software architecture and builds on a <strong>Smart Geographical Information System (GIS)</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="why-it-started">Why it Started</h4>

<figure>
<p><img src="assets/images/superc3-why.png" alt="Desktop application built on a GIS" /></p>
  <figcaption>The legacy system that the Super C3 System replaces has poor UX, requires tasks to be completed manually and has poor data integration</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Super C3 System replaces an existing legacy system that has become <strong>increasingly obsolete</strong>. With the outdated system, <strong>user experience was poor</strong>, and many mundane and procedural tasks with automation potential still <strong>had to be done manually</strong>. A new replacement was long overdue to improve work efficiency. Advances in communication technology also mean data integration is now possible to allow <strong>better interoperability across the army forces</strong>, which was previously impossible with the old technology and poorly integrated modules.</p>

<h4 id="primary-design-goals">Primary Design Goals</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Create a user-friendly experience to <strong>reduce resources on user training</strong> by aligning with commercial design patterns.</li>
  <li><strong>Be a great landing pad</strong>. Many users will be transitioning from the existing legacy system, which should be a fluid experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Raise work efficiency</strong> by harnessing the potential of automation, eliminating the effort required for procedural tasks.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="team-structure">Team Structure</h3>

<figure>
<p><img src="assets/images/superc3-team.png" alt="Team structure" /></p>
  <figcaption>The project team splits into smaller development teams consisting a lead developer and couple with one or a pair of UX designers</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Managed by two product managers, the project team consists of ~20 software developers and a small design team. The design team grew from a strength of two to four towards the last quarter of 2021.</p>

<p>The project team splits into 3-5 development teams (depending on the project timeline) and practices the <strong>Scrum methodology, with bi-weekly sprints</strong> held concurrently. Each development team has a ScrumMaster cum lead developer and couples with at least one or a pair of UX designers.</p>

<p>I was matched with three development teams and collaborated closely with a fellow UX designer when she joined the team.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-design-process">The Design Process</h3>
<p>For the modules in the system under my charge, I adhered to a consistent design process in my delivery.</p>

<h4 id="user-research">User Research</h4>
<p>As a team, I conducted user research sessions through <strong>qualitative user interviews</strong> and <strong>user research workshops</strong> to <strong>elicit user needs and pain points</strong> from the users’ existing work processes.</p>

<p>We also <strong>synthesised design opportunities</strong> from ‘How Might We’ statements gathered from these user research sessions.</p>

<h4 id="insights">Insights</h4>
<p>I generated <strong>UX artefacts to document complex military workflows</strong> and align the project team in the existing user flows.</p>

<h4 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h4>
<p>I created the <strong>information architecture</strong> and <strong>low-fidelity concepts</strong> for primary use cases and workflows. After obtaining the green light from the product managers, developers and stakeholders, these concepts are translated to <strong>high-fidelity and interactive digital mock-ups</strong>, most times by my teammate or occasionally by myself.</p>

<h4 id="usability-testing">Usability Testing</h4>
<p>I <strong>led my team to conduct testings</strong> of our product to verify designs nearing product release.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Before product releases, we tested our designs with various user groups by <strong>simulating mission scenarios</strong> to ensure the product was usable and covered all their operational needs.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="seeing-results">Seeing Results</h3>

<figure>
<p><img src="assets/images/superc3-results.png" alt="Impact on the project's UX in quantitative terms" /></p>
  <figcaption>The overall system usability improved following a revamp of the system’s UX.</figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>overall system usability improved</strong> from an average System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 50.0 to 63.6 following a revamp of the system’s user experience.</li>
  <li>For one of the modules I designed,
    <ul>
      <li>The average SUS score was <strong>80.8</strong>, and</li>
      <li>a user estimated the module to <strong>reduce up to 90% of the total time required</strong> in their existing workflow.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="a-mini-design-system">A Mini Design System</h3>
<p>I co-led the delivery of a <strong>mini design system</strong> that specifies the system’s design principles and guidelines. This mini design system helps ensure design consistency throughout the Super C3 System and alignment with the C3D Design System.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="project-learnings">Project Learnings</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Anyone can be a user (but yourself).</strong> It is easy to fall prey to the false-consensus effect when designing. Always test to verify a design. When time is lacking, anyone can be the user, including our project mates. Sometimes, a fresh new perspective is all that is needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Test early and continuously.</strong> Involving stakeholders/users in the process as early as possible can help identify loopholes and unlock insights that save precious time and effort later on.</li>
  <li><strong>Prioritisation is key.</strong> Focus on delivering a quality MVP first when rolling out new features/functions and avoid getting distracted by out-of-scope requests (or sometimes, even your own ideas).</li>
  <li><strong>The design ≠ the final product.</strong> Sometimes we can get carried away with producing pixel-perfect designs, but what matters most is always the final product delivered. When resources are tight, ensuring the product is developed right should be the priority.</li>
</ol>
