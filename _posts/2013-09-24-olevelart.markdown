This is my Higher Art Ordinary Level coursework submission piece, a typography art piece depicting the dire effects of procrastination on one’s dreams and aspirations. The single trickle of sand is symbolic in its representation of endless, merciless time that waits for no one. While no one wants to see their dreams and aspirations buried and lost in time, this chilling vision might just become true if time is wasted away with procrastination.

All elements in this art piece are fashioned from letters and words relevant to what each entity represents.
