### About DSTA

DSTA is an agency under Singapore's defence ministry and was formed to deliver innovative solutions to enhance the fighting capabilities of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). It is a multidisciplinary organisation that covers the diverse needs of the SAF, and its portfolio ranges from acquisition management, digitised platforms, cyber analytics, software development and more. 

### My Role

![C3D Design Innovation Team](/assets/images/dsta-di.png)

I joined DSTA's C3 Development (C3D) Programme Centre, as a UX architect in the Design Innovation (DI) Team. As a member of the DI team, I help ensure that DSTA's products are user-centred and help deliver new or improved defence systems with great user experiences in DSTA's quest for defence software modernisation. As a team, we rigorously engage the SAF users in our design processes to understand their military workflow and help them streamline these existing processes to save precious time and effort. 


### My Assignment

I was assigned to co-lead the design of an advanced command and control system, which was in a form of a large scale desktop application. The project team was co-managed by two product managers and consisted of 20 software developers. The design team grew from a strength of two to four towards the last quarter of 2021. 

The project team was split into 3-5 development teams (varying depending on the project timeline), each consisting of a ScrumMaster cum lead developer and a few other developers. In a quest to push for a user-centred product, the project team practices an agile framework, with concurrent bi-weekly sprints for each development team.

### Project Overview

The project aims to deliver a powerful desktop application that is meant to serve the planning and monitoring needs of army soldiers across various vocations during wartime operations. It follows a modular software architecture and is built on a Smart Geographical Infomation System (GIS). 

### Why it Started

The project was started to replace an existing system running on a legacy system and which has become increasingly obsolete in recent years. The outdated system affected user experience and the old technology meant that many mundane and procedural tasks that could be automated were still being done manually. The new system, therefore, harnesses new technology such as automation to raise work efficiency and simultaneously offer a seamless integration of data to improve interoperability across the army, which was not possible in the old system.

### My Contributions

I led the delivery of about 5 modules within the system and saw through two product releases of the system through the design cycle, during which:
* I conducted user research through interviews, observations and user workshops to elicit user needs
* I did up prototypes, which ranged from paper sketches to high-fidelity and interactive design mock-ups
* I provided and solicited critique on my designs and that of my team-mates' during internal design critique sessions
* I led the planning and conducting of usability tests to further improve designs
* I oversaw the implementation of designs for product release
    → For one of the modules I led, a user estimated the module to reduce up to 90% of the total time taken in their existing workflow.

On top of that, I also co-led the delivery of a mini design system with design principles and guidelines to ensure design consistency throughout the system and also its adherence to the C3D Design System. 

### Tools I Used

* Collaboration Tools: Jira, Confluence
* Design Tools: Adobe XD, Axure RP9
