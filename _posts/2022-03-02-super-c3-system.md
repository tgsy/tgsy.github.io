summary: "I co-led a design team to deliver a state of the art C3 (Command, Control and Communication) system, in the form of a <b>large-scale desktop app</b>, through two product releases. As a team, we conducted user research, went through numerous design iterations and tested our designs before shipping a user-centred defence system that <b>streamlines existing military processes and saves our users precious time and effort.</b>"

### About the Project

<div class="additional-notes"><h4>❓ What are C3 Systems?</h4>In the military context, C3 Systems are fundamental to operations by delivering the critical information required to <b>plan, coordinate and control forces and operations across defence missions</b> in real-time.</div>

#### What the Super C3 System is
The Super C3 System is a powerful desktop app that serves the **planning, monitoring and execution needs** of army soldiers across the various vocations during wartime exercises and operations. It follows a modular software architecture and builds on a **Smart Geographical Information System (GIS)**.

#### Why it Started

The Super C3 System replaces an existing legacy system that has become **increasingly obsolete**. With the outdated system, **user experience was poor**, and many mundane and procedural tasks with automation potential still **had to be done manually**. A new replacement was long overdue to improve work efficiency. Advances in communication technology also mean data integration is now possible to allow **better interoperability across the army forces**, which was previously impossible with the old technology and poorly integrated modules.

#### Primary Design Goals
* Create a user-friendly experience to **reduce resources on user training** by aligning with commercial design patterns.
* **Be a great landing pad**. Many users will be transitioning from the existing legacy system, which should be a fluid experience. 
* **Raise work efficiency** by harnessing the potential of automation, eliminating the effort required for procedural tasks.

### Team Structure

</figure>

Managed by two product managers, the project team consists of ~20 software developers and a small design team. The design team grew from a strength of two to four towards the last quarter of 2021. 

The project team splits into 3-5 development teams (depending on the project timeline) and practices the **Scrum methodology, with bi-weekly sprints** held concurrently. Each development team has a ScrumMaster cum lead developer and couples with at least one or a pair of UX designers.

I was matched with three development teams and collaborated closely with a fellow UX designer when she joined the team.

### The Design Process
For the modules in the system under my charge, I adhered to a consistent design process in my delivery.

#### User Research
As a team, I conducted user research sessions through **qualitative user interviews** and **user research workshops** to **elicit user needs and pain points** from the users' existing work processes.

We also **synthesised design opportunities** from 'How Might We' statements gathered from these user research sessions.

#### Insights
I generated **UX artefacts to document complex military workflows** and align the project team in the existing user flows.

#### Prototyping
I created the **information architecture** and **low-fidelity concepts** for primary use cases and workflows. After obtaining the green light from the product managers, developers and stakeholders, these concepts are translated to **high-fidelity and interactive digital mock-ups**, most times by my teammate or occasionally by myself.

#### Usability Testing
I **led my team to conduct testings** of our product to verify designs nearing product release.
* Before product releases, we tested our designs with various user groups by **simulating mission scenarios** to ensure the product was usable and covered all their operational needs.

### Seeing Results
<figure>

  <figcaption>The overall system usability improved from 50.0 to 63.6 following a revamp of the system's UX. A module I designed was rated a SUS score of 80.8 (falling into the 'Good' category of the SUS Acceptability Score range) and was estimated by a user to reduce up to 90% of the total time required in their existing workflow.

* The **overall system usability improved** from an average System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 50.0 to 63.6 following a revamp of the system's user experience.
* For one of the modules I designed, 
  * The average SUS score was **80.8**, and
  * a user estimated the module to **reduce up to 90% of the total time required** in their existing workflow.

### A Mini Design System
I co-led the delivery of a **mini design system** that specifies the system's design principles and guidelines. This mini design system helps ensure design consistency throughout the Super C3 System and alignment with the C3D Design System.

### Project Learnings
1. **Anyone can be a user (but yourself).** It is easy to fall prey to the false-consensus effect when designing. Always test to verify a design. When time is lacking, anyone can be the user, including our project mates. Sometimes, a fresh new perspective is all that is needed.
2. **Test early and continuously.** Involving stakeholders/users in the process as early as possible can help identify loopholes and unlock insights that save precious time and effort later on. 
3. **Prioritisation is key.** Focus on delivering a quality MVP first when rolling out new features/functions and avoid getting distracted by out-of-scope requests (or sometimes, even your own ideas).
4. **The design ≠ the final product.** Sometimes we can get carried away with producing pixel-perfect designs, but what matters most is always the final product delivered. When resources are tight, ensuring the product is developed right should be the priority.
