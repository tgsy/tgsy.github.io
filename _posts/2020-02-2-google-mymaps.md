summary: "I improved the Google MyMaps experience for travellers who use it for trip planning. I derived my solution by first conducting a heuristic study of the existing tool and understanding its shortfalls when compared to its competitors. I also conducted user research to identify desirable features that typical users are looking for in such itinerary planning tools. "

### About the App

Google MyMaps is an online mapping tool that allows its users to easily create custom maps (by themselves or with others) that saves custom places for sharing purposes. It is available on both the web and mobile platform. One of the largest user group consists of travellers who use the app for travel planning and navigating on the go. 

With rising competitors in the form of online travel planning sites and mobile apps that offers better UX in the industry, a redesign is overdue for it to stay relevant to travellers.
