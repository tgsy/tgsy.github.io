Analysing Second Skin, a case study from bioLogic, MIT Media Lab and gaining inspiration, the team designed ways to transform formal wear to become more suitable for wear in Singapore’s tropical climate. By means of conducting a survey allowed the team to identify the crux of what contributes most to the discomfort of business shirts. Through multiple experiments, the conceptual product delivered for the final exhibition was proven to be effective.

I was the creative designer of this design project in charge of producing materials that help visually communicate the complexities of the conceptual product throughout the designing process.
