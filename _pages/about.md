Born and bred in **Singapore**, I am currently based in the **Defence Science and Technology Agency of Singapore** as a **UX architect**. It's my first job after graduating with a **B.E. (Hons) in Computer Science (with a specialisation track in UX/UI Design)** from the Singapore University of Technology and Design. I am on an active lookout for opportunitites. 

I ventured into the UX industry because I found myself more fascinated with the design process while working on projects, during which I get to interact with people more rather than the code. 

In my free time, I enjoy travelling, reading and skectching.
