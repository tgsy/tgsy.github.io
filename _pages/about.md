Born and bred in Singapore, I am currently based in the Defence Science and Technology Agency of Singapore as a **UX architect**. It's my first job after graduating with a B.E. (Hons) in Computer Science (with a specialisation track in UX/UI Design) from the Singapore University of Technology and Design. I am on a active lookout for opportunitites. 

I ventured into the UX industry because I found myself more fascinated with the design process of a product during projects, during which I get to interact with people more rather than the implementation where I'll deal more with code. 

In my free time, I also enjoy sketching and reading.

If you will like to hear more about me or think that I'll be a good fit for your team, feel free to drop me a message via email or LinkedIn to get in touch with me. I look forward to hearing from you!
