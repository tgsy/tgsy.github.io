### 👋 Why hello there, I'm Tessa!
Born and bred in **Singapore**, my latest job experience was as a **Senior UX Architect** in the [Defence Science and Technology Agency of Singapore](https://www.dsta.gov.sg/home){:target="_blank"}. It was my first job after graduating with a **B.E. (Hons) in Computer Science (with a specialisation track in UX/UI Design)** from the Singapore University of Technology and Design in 2019.
