I"ë!<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>

<p>The main reasons behind the re-design were as such:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The site looked <strong>outdated</strong> and contained visuals of poor resolution.</li>
  <li>It <strong>did not offer a seamless experience across all devices</strong>.</li>
  <li>It neither met <strong>new business needs</strong> nor reflected the <strong>businessâ€™s values</strong> well.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="research">Research</h3>

<h4 id="target-audience">Target audience</h4>

<p>To <strong>identify the main types of users</strong> visiting the companyâ€™s website, I <strong>scouted past contact form submissions</strong> to understand why users visited the site.</p>

<figure>
<p><img src="assets/images/av-redesign-formsubmissions.png" alt="Form submissions taken from Achieva Vending Pte Ltd's website" /></p>
  <figcaption>Past contact form submissions</figcaption>

<p>The main types of users identified were:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Potential customers looking for vending solutions</strong>,</li>
  <li>Existing customers in need of <strong>service support</strong> or wishing to <strong>provide feedback</strong> and</li>
  <li>Food and beverage <strong>suppliers looking for collaboration</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="content-strategy">Content Strategy</h4>

<p>I spoke to the founder and sales team to understand the <strong>companyâ€™s strategy in standing out from its competitors</strong>.</p>

<figure>
<p><img src="assets/images/av-redesign-values.png" alt="What Achieva Vending Pte Ltd strives towards in its services" /></p>

</figure>

<h4 id="voice-and-tone">Voice and Tone</h4>

<p>What sets the company apart, as an SME, is also the cordialness it offers to its customers. With this and the above list in mind, the improved website should, therefore, adopt a <strong>clean</strong> look and adopt a <strong>friendly tone of writing</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="ideation">Ideation</h3>

<h4 id="competitive-analysis">Competitive Analysis</h4>

<p>For the initial brainstorming, I sourced inspiration from the websites of other vending providers, both local and abroad and identified the good attributes that I could learn from, such as <strong>understanding common industry terms to help in clarity in communication for the new website</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="information-architecture">Information Architecture</h4>

<p>After a preliminary sharing and discussion with the business owners, some sections in the proposed IA were removed due to business considerations and eventually looked like this:</p>

<figure>
<p><img src="assets/images/av-redesign-ia.png" alt="Improved site map for Achieva Vending's website" /></p>

</figure>

<p>The new website adds a new â€˜Careersâ€™ page to help raise the visibility of the vacancies available in the company given the businessâ€™s manpower shortage needs.</p>

<h4 id="wireframing">Wireframing</h4>

<p>I started conceptualising by first creating low-fi wireframes on a note-taking app.</p>

<div id="slider1">

</div>

<script src="/bower_components/ideal-image-slider/ideal-image-slider.js"></script>

<script src="/bower_components/ideal-image-slider/extensions/bullet-nav/iis-bullet-nav.js"></script>

<script src="/bower_components/ideal-image-slider/extensions/captions/iis-captions.js"></script>

<script>
  // new IdealImageSlider.Slider('#slider');
  var slider1 = new IdealImageSlider.Slider({
	selector: '#slider1',
	//height: 400, // Required but can be set by CSS
	interval: 4000
});
  // var slider = new IdealImageSlider.Slider('#slider');
  slider1.addBulletNav();
  slider1.addCaptions();
  slider1.start();
</script>

<h3 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h3>

<h4 id="color-scheme">Color Scheme</h4>

<p>The siteâ€™s colour scheme builds upon the colours existing in the companyâ€™s logo by adding a colour (Trypan Blue #3D14B8) that is complementary to the Apple Green (#8fb914) present in the logo.</p>

<h4 id="high-fidelity-prototypes">High-fidelity prototypes</h4>

<p>I made the hi-fi prototypes with <strong>Sketch</strong>, the visual graphics with <strong>Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="the-final-product">The Final Product</h3>

<h4 id="implementation">Implementation</h4>
<p>The site was <strong>implemented and published with Weebly</strong>. I built the site on top of an existing theme available and then modified it to match my designs using the HTML editor. Below are screenshots of the improved website.</p>

<h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h3>

<h4 id="constraints">Constraints</h4>
<p><strong>Budget considerations</strong> and <strong>limited functionalities</strong> of the Weebly website builder meant that many design decisions had to be tweaked due to a lack of <strong>feasibility in implementation</strong>, or else to ensure a seamlessly <strong>responsive experience</strong> across mobile devices.</p>

<h4 id="areas-for-improvement">Areas for Improvement</h4>
<p><strong>Vending Machine specifications</strong> such as the machinesâ€™ dimensions and power input are required to allow potential customers to <strong>gauge the feasibility of employing the companyâ€™s services</strong> before reaching out. This information was included in the initial planning during ideation but has been omitted later due to the lack of data available.</p>

<h3 id="project-learningstakeaways">Project Learnings/Takeaways</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Focus on building an MVP first.</strong> In an SME, there is only so much time and effort that its staff can invest for you, so itâ€™s important to focus on building an MVP and then improving from there (e.g. including vending machine specifications)</li>
  <li><strong>Always make sure you fully understand your constraints prior to designing.</strong> I began re-designing certain micro-interactions without first verifying if it was feasible to implement those designs on the site builder. I later had to tweak my design to fit within the constraints of Weeblyâ€™s site-building tools.</li>
  <li><strong>Business considerations are prime.</strong> As much as UX is important to me as a UX practitioner, paying more monthly to deploy a website that offers a better UX to the site visitors but has little add-on value to the business is deemed unnecessary by the business owners. As such, the improved website still builds upon the Weebly website builder, instead of other website builders available in the market that offers greater flexibility in design.</li>
